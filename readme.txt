This is the MP2 submission for Abhishek Harish, netId harish2. 
I am a student in 3 credit hour section. 

I made the I for the extra credit and made it in 15 points. 

I did the MP in xCode, so I am not submitting the executable file, but in the archive you will find the source code and my main.cpp file. The other required class and .h files are also included. Just add everything to a existing Xcode OpenGL project and it will run fine .  

Link all the header files to main.cpp and then run the main function. 

The plane can move at variable speeds and can slow down and stop and even go in reverse. 
The sea level can be increases and decreases and the detail of the terrain could also be controlled by the user. 
The plane can increase/decrease it’s height like a helicopter

The instruction to run the program are following ;

‘1’ increases the sea level
‘2’ decreases the sea level

‘3’ makes the texture of the terrain finer
‘4’ makes the texture of the terrain coarser

‘q’ moves the plane up, increases it’s height (like a helicopter
‘e’ moves the plane down, decreases it’s height (like a helicopter

‘w’ increases the speed of the plane in the direction in which it is moving
‘s’ decreases the speed of the plane in the direction in which it is moving
‘a’ makes the plane yaw left
‘d’ makes the plane yaw right

‘Left arrow’ makes the plane roll to the left
‘Right arrow’ makes the plane roll to the right
‘Up arrow’ makes the plane pitch up
‘Down arrow’ makes the plane pitch down

‘escape’ key, closes the window and exits the program.
